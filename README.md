# music-sync-converter
Sync music to MP3 players, phones, flash drives for car radios and such. Detect and convert unsupported files automatically.
Works on Windows and Linux, macOS is untested.

## Features
- sync only files that have been added/removed/changed
- works with any directory structure (does not force you into a certain way of managing your music library)
- use a local directory or WebDAV (e.g. Nextcloud) as a source
- exclude files/directories
- use a local directory, MTP (Windows-only) or ADB as a target
- convert unsupported files on-the-fly using FFMPEG
    - detect file support by extension, container, codec, profile, ...
    - override codec settings for certain paths
- fast conversion due to pipelining and multithreading
- automatically embed album art from the directory into the file
- handle miscellaneous device limitations (configurable)
    - unsupported file formats/containers
    - unsupported characters in path and tags
    - resolve playlists to a directory with the playlist's songs
    - sorting by FAT32 file table order
    - case-sensitive sorting
    - limited directory depth

## Installation
### Dependencies:
- required
    - .NET 6 SDK
    - ffmpeg (including ffprobe)
- optional
    - adb (for sync to Android devices via adb)
    - flac (including metaflac) to handle flac files with multiple tag values correctly
    - vorbis-tools (including vorbiscomment) to handle ogg / opus files with multiple tag values correctly

All of these should be installed so they are are in PATH.

.NET SDK can be found at https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download for all platforms

Windows:
- ffmpeg: https://www.gyan.dev/ffmpeg/builds/
- flac: https://ftp.osuosl.org/pub/xiph/releases/flac/ 
- vorbis-tools: https://ftp.osuosl.org/pub/xiph/releases/vorbis/

These have to be added to PATH manually.

On Linux/MacOS you can probably just install these using the package manager (e.g. `apt install ffmpeg flac vorbis-tools`).

## Usage:
`dotnet run --project src\MusicSyncConverter\MusicSyncConverter -- config.json`

You can split the configuration file into multiple files and supply multiple config files as arguments, which might be useful if converting for different end devices but with the same directory settings.

## Config options
Also see [example configs below](#example-configs).

### SourceDir
The source directory as an URI.
- File system: `file://` (for example `file://C:/Users/me/Music` or `file://~/Music` or `file:///home/me/Music`)
- WebDAV: `http(s)://` (for example `https://user:password@nextcloud.example.com/remote.php/dav/files/me/Music`)

### TargetDir
The target directory as an URI.
Be aware that everything in this directory will be deleted (unless it is hidden or already synchronized to the source dir).
- File system: `file://` (for example `file://F:/Music` or `file:///mnt/usb/Music`)
    - supports the query parameter `?fatSortMode=<mode>` where `<mode>` is `None`, `Folders`, `Files`, `FilesAndFolders` to sort the FAT32 table when directories change. This is useful for devices that don't sort files or directory by name.
- (on Windows) MTP using [WPD](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/windows-portable-devices): `wpd://` (for example `wpd://My Android Phone/disk/Music`)
    - Don't expect this to be rock-solid. It's MTP, what do you expect?
- ADB: `adb://` (for example `adb://abcdABCD12345678//storage/0815-ACAB/Music` where `abcdABCD12345678` is the device serial number and `/storage/0815-ACAB/Music` is the base directory)
    - this requires ADB to be installed globally (available in `PATH`) or an ADB daemon to be already running

### Exclude
Array of files or directories you want to exclude.
Wildcards `*` (any directory) and `**` (any directory structure) are supported.

Examples:
- `Audio Books` ignores `Audio Books/` in the root folder
- `Music/**/Instrumentals` ignores `Music/Example Artist/Instrumentals` and `Music/Albums/Example Artist/Instrumentals`
- `Music/*/Instrumentals` ignores `Music/Example Artist/Instrumentals` but not `Music/Albums/Example Artist/Instrumentals`
- `Music/Albums/**/*.m3u` ignores `Music/Albums/Example Artist/playlist.m3u` but not `Music/Playlists/playlist.m3u`

### DeviceConfig
In case you want to sync your music to multiple devices, it may be helpful to put this section in a seperate file each.

#### SupportedFormats
Format conversion works by analyzing the source file, comparing the format against the configured supported formats and converting to the configured fallback format if necessary

The supported format includes:
- `Extension`: File extension (required)
- `Codec`: Codec as reported by ffprobe, for example `aac` (required)
- `Profile`: Profile as reported by ffprobe, for example `LC` for AAC-LC
- `MaxChannels`: Max. number of audio channels
- `MaxSampleRateHz`: Max. sample rate in Hz
- `MaxBitrate`: Max. bitrate in kbit/s

"as reported by ffprobe" =>
```
Stream #0:0(und): Audio: aac (LC) (mp4a)
                   Codec ^    ^ Profile

Stream #0:0(und): Audio: aac (HE-AAC)
                   Codec ^    ^ Profile

Stream #0:0: Audio: mp3
              Codec ^
```

#### FallbackFormat
The fallback format includes:
- `Extension`: File extension (required)
- `Muxer`: Muxer (usually the container format), for example `mp3`, `ogg`, `ipod` (required)
- `Codec`: Codec as required by ffmpeg, for example `libmp3lame`, `libopus` or `aac` (required)
- `Profile`: Profile as required by ffmpeg
- `Channels`: Number of audio channels
- `SampleRateHz`: Sample rate in Hz
- `AdditionalFlags`: Additional parameters to pass to ffmpeg, for example `-movflags faststart`, which is required by a lot of players using the `mp4` or `ipod` muxer
- `Bitrate`: Bitrate in kbit/s
- `CoverCodec`: Format to use for album covers (`mjpeg` = jpg, `png` = png, `null` = remove album covers)
- `MaxCoverSize`: Max. cover size in either axis

"as required by ffmpeg" =>
```
ffmpeg -i input.mp3 -c:a aac -profile:a aac_low
           Encoder/Codec ^              ^ Profile (if applicable)
```

##### Album covers
If there are files named `cover.png`, `cover.jpg`, `folder.jpg`, in a song's directory, the album cover is added to the song (if the fallback format includes a cover codec).
If there's already an album cover embedded in the file, that one will be preferred.


#### (Path/Tag)CharacterLimitations
Use this as to replace characters that aren't supported by your device (either in path name, tags, or both).

- `SupportedUnicodeRanges`: Supported Unicode ranges (e.g. `BasicLatin`, `Latin1Supplement`, `GeneralPunctuation`, etc.)
- `SupportedCharacters`: Additional supported characters
- `Replacements`: Manual replacement chars (for `Ã¤` -> `ae` etc.)
- `NormalizationMode`
    - `None`: Off
    - `NonBmp`: Replace all non-BMP characters (characters above U+FFFF). Usually required on Android as it doesn't support those characters
    - `Unsupported`: Try to replace characters not in supported list

Characters that are unsupported in file/path names will be replaced by `_` automatically.

#### ResolvePlaylists
There are two ways to handle `m3u` / `m3u8` playlists:
##### `false` (default):
Each playlist is copied to the target directory. All references are updated to point to the correct file if required (e.g. if the file extension changes due to a format conversion).

##### `true`:
Each playlist is created as a directory containing the referenced songs.
The `EXTINF` name is used as a file name if available (else the source file name is used).
so the playlist `Playlists/Test.m3u8`
with the contents
```m3u
#EXTM3U
#EXTINF:253,An Artist - Song 4
..\Artists\An Artist\An Album\04 Song 4.flac
```
results in the directory `Playlists/Test/` with the file `An Artist - Song 4.flac`

#### TagValueDelimiter
If set, multiple tags (for example multiple artists) will be separated by this character.

#### NormalizeCase
If `true`, makes the first character of each file/path name uppercase. Useful for devices that sort by ASCII code instead of (case-insensitive) letter.

#### MaxDirectoryDepth
If set, limits the directory depth to the specified value (when set to 4, `One/Two/Three/Four/Five/Test.mp3` becomes `One/Two/Three/Four_Five/Test.mp3`)


### PathFormatOverrides
Use this to overwrite encoder settings depending on the directory that is being converted. These overrides are based on the [FallbackFormat](#fallbackformat), unless the file already fits all limitations the overrides require.

This can be useful for:
- Setting different encoder settings for different types of media (like reducing channel count or bitrate for audio books)
- Limiting maximum bitrate (just setting `MaxBitrate` means all media above this bitrate will be converted to the FallbackFormat bitrate or MaxBitrate, whichever is lower)

### WorkersRead/WorkersConvert/WorkersWrite
The number of workers to use for each step.

## Example configs:
### Minimal config:
- Sync `Z:\Audio` to `E:\Audio`
- Convert all files (regardless of current format) to 192kbit/s MP3
- Keep/embed album art as 320x320px JPEG

```js
{
    "SourceDir": "file://Z:\\Audio\\",
    "TargetDir": "file://E:\\Audio\\",
    "DeviceConfig": {
        "FallbackFormat": {
            "Extension": ".mp3",
            "Codec": "mp3", // as required by ffmpeg (-c:a aac)
            "Muxer": "mp3", // as required by ffmpeg (usually, this is the container format)
            "Bitrate": 192, // kbit/s
            "CoverCodec": "mjpeg", // format to use for album covers ("mjpeg" = jpg, "png" = png, null = remove album covers)
            "MaxCoverSize": 320 // maximum size of album covers in either axis (null = keep original size)
        }
    }
}
```

### Advanced example:
- Sync `Z:\Audio` to `E:\Audio`
- Reorder file table on target (required if the target device doesn't sort files and/or folders by itself and instead uses the FAT order)
- Exclude `Z:\Audio\Webradio`, `Z:\Audio\Music\Artists\Nickelback` and `Z:\Audio\Music\Artists\**\Instrumentals` (`*` and `**` wildcards are supported)
- Copy all MP3, WMA and AAC-LC files
- Convert all other files to AAC-LC 192kbit/s
- Convert album covers to jpeg with 320x320 px max (while retaining aspect ratio)
- Replace unsupported characters in path names
- Replace non-BMP characters in path names (characters that can't be represented with UCS-2) (required for Android devices)
- Keep all characters in tags as they are
- Change every first character of file/dir names to uppercase so devices that sort case-sensitive work properly
- Resolve playlists to directories
- Override codec settings for  `Z:\Audio\Audio Books` so all audio books are converted to 64kbit/s mono to save storage space
